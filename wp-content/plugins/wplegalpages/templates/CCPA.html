<h4>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will disclose to you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The categories of personal information we've collected about you.</li>
    <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we've collected about you.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
            <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Deletion Request Rights</h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
    <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
    <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
    <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.). Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
    <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
    <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h4>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Calling us at [Phone]</li>
    <li>Emailing us at [Email]</li>
</ul>
<p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we've collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<h4>Response Timing and Format</h4>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<h4>Personal Information Sales</h4>
<p>We will not sell your personal information to any party. If in the future, we anticipate selling your personal information to any party, we will provide you with the opt-out and opt-in rights required by the CCPA.</p>
<h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
    <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
